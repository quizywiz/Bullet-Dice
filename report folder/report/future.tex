\section{Future Improvements}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The first improvement we could make is to run the algorithm to find the optimal cuboidal dice manually, using physical instantiations of the dice. It would not take too many prints to get a decent discrepancy.\\
    \item The only time we manipulated weights in this project was to make sure the probability of one side was non zero. We have not experimented with non-uniform densities and weights in either the simulated or the physical instantiations, although non-uniform densities might be difficult to instantiate physically.\\
    \item We could improve the accuracy of the simulator by making it use all the tensor values for moment of inertia rather than just the diagonal entries.\\
    \item We could control the friction and coefficient of restitution of the surface to see how that influences the discrepancy.\\
